However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\n \nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n \n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\n\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n  if (props.isAdmin) {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n  }\n};\n\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n  let searchKeyFound = false;\n  Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n    if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n      searchKeyFound = true;\n    }\n  });\n  return searchKeyFound;\n};\n\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\"}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as user.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n \nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"isAdmin\": true}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props);\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\n}\n```\n \nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\"isAdmin\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n ```","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h"},"1096856":{"findings":[{"version":"1.15.2","paths":["axios>follow-redirects"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<=1.15.5","module_name":"follow-redirects","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp","cves":["CVE-2024-28849"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=1.15.6","cvss":{"score":6.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},"updated":"2024-04-02T17:54:22.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 1.15.6 or later","cwe":["CWE-200"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1096856,"references":"- https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/security/advisories/GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp\n- https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/commit/c4f847f85176991f95ab9c88af63b1294de8649b\n- https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#authentication-entries\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28849\n- https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/1885\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/2390009\n- https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOIF4EPQUCKDBEVTGRQDZ3CGTYQHPO7Z\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp","created":"2024-03-14T17:19:42.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"follow-redirects' Proxy-Authorization header kept across hosts","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"When using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), its dependency follow-redirects only clears authorization header during cross-domain redirect, but allows the proxy-authentication header which contains credentials too.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce & PoC\n\nTest code:\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\naxios.get('http://127.0.0.1:10081/', {\n headers: {\n 'AuThorization': 'Rear Test',\n 'ProXy-AuthoriZation': 'Rear Test',\n 'coOkie': 't=1'\n }\n})\n .then((response) => {\n console.log(response);\n })\n```\n\nWhen I meet the cross-domain redirect, the sensitive headers like authorization and cookie are cleared, but proxy-authentication header is kept.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis vulnerability may lead to credentials leak.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nRemove proxy-authentication header during cross-domain redirect\n\n### Recommended Patch\n\n[follow-redirects/index.js:464](https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/commit/c4f847f85176991f95ab9c88af63b1294de8649b)\n\n```diff\n- removeMatchingHeaders(/^(?:authorization|cookie)$/i, this._options.headers);\n+ removeMatchingHeaders(/^(?:authorization|proxy-authorization|cookie)$/i, this._options.headers);\n```","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp"},"1097346":{"findings":[{"version":"2.0.0","paths":["nunjucks>chokidar>fsevents>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip","express-nunjucks>nunjucks-async-loader>chokidar>fsevents>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>socks-proxy-agent>socks>ip"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<=2.0.1","module_name":"ip","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp","cves":["CVE-2024-29415"],"access":"public","patched_versions":"<0.0.0","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"updated":"2024-06-02T22:29:30.000Z","recommendation":"None","cwe":["CWE-918"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1097346,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29415\n- https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/issues/150\n- https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/143\n- https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/pull/144\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp","created":"2024-06-02T22:29:29.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"ip SSRF improper categorization in isPublic","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"The ip package through 2.0.1 for Node.js might allow SSRF because some IP addresses (such as 127.1, 01200034567, 012.1.2.3, 000:0:0000::01, and ::fFFf:127.0.0.1) are improperly categorized as globally routable via isPublic.
